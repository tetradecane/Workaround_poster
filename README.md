# The Symptoms, Causes, and Repairs of Workarounds in Apache Issue Trackers

## Project summary

Nowadays issue tracker systems are widely used to manage bug reports. In such a system, a bug report can be filed, diagnosed, assigned, and fixed. In the standard process, a bug can be resolved as *fixed*, *invalid*, *duplicated* or *won't fix*. Besides these above resolutions, a bug report can be resolved to a less known result, *i.e.*, a workaround. Compared with other resolutions, the definition of a workaround is more ambiguous. Although some early studies have been conducted to analyze API workarounds, many research questions on workarounds are still open. For example, what bugs are often resolved as workarounds? Why is a bug report resolved as a workaround? What are the repairs and impacts of workarounds? In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to explore the above research questions. In this study, we analyzed 221 real workarounds that were collected from 88 Apache projects. Our results lead to ten findings and our answers to all the above research questions. Furthermore, we interpret the significance of our findings to different users, programmers, and issue tracker designers.

## Workaround Dataset

In this paper, we analyze 221 real workarounds that were collected from 88 Apache projects.

## Inspection Result

In the dataset, we provide the JIRA ids, symptoms, causes, repairs of collected workarounds.
