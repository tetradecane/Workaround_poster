# The Symptoms, Causes, and Repairs of Workarounds in Apache Issue Trackers

## Project summary

In issue tracker systems, a bug report can be resolved as *workaround*. Since the definition of workarounds is more ambiguous, many research questions on workarounds are still open. For example, which bugs are resolved as workarounds? Why is a bug report resolved as workarounds? What are the repairs and impacts of workarounds? In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to explore the above research questions. In particular, we analyzed 221 real workarounds that were collected from 88 Apache projects. Our results lead to ten findings and our answers to all the above questions. Our findings are useful to understand workarounds and to improve software projects and issue trackers.

## Workaround Dataset

In this paper, we analyze 221 real workarounds that were collected from 88 Apache projects.

## Inspection Result

In the dataset, we provide the JIRA IDs, symptoms, causes, repairs of the collected workarounds.
